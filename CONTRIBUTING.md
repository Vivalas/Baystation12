Yonaguni-specific CONTRIBUTING.md:
- Anything that can safely target Bay and fits the Bay content requirements should go to Bay.
- Anything that breaks compatibility with Bay's dev branch should be as self-contained and modular as possible.
- PRs require a signoff from a maintainer before being merged by a second maintainer, or 24 hours to pass for discussion, whichever comes first.
